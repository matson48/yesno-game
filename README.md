# Boolean Turing Test
![Screenshot of the game](promo/screenshot-3.png) 

A [visual novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel) style game in which you play as an artificial intelligence trying to pass a version of the [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) that only uses yes or no questions.

It is a bit of a satirical take on the concept, to demonstrate shortcomings of the Turing test and artificial intelligence and general. I pushed things too close to the deadline, though, and the script is currently not very well written. This project is mainly a tech demo for my [SGLscript](https://github.com/matson48/sglscript-godot) add-on, to show its potential for making visual novels with elaborate animations difficult to accomplish in other engines—particularly in regards to 3D backgrounds.

Made for the [Dec 2016/Jan 2017 Godot Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/godotjam122016). The "two buttons" theme inspired the questions only having yes or no answers.

Project under MIT license, like Godot.
